    "text": "Exercises\nFor all exercises, you should respond in the space provided in the template lab-0.qmd and show all your work. This lab-0 just has a few warm-up exercises to introduce you to some computing phenomena and general ideas.\n\nFloating point algebra.\n\nDo floating point numbers obey the rules of algebra? For example, one of the rules of algebra is additive association. (x + y) + z == x + (y + z). Check if this true in R using \\(x = 0.1\\), \\(y = 0.1\\) and \\(z = 1\\). Explain what you find.\n\nAdditional examples of floating point pecularity are provided below.\n\n# example 1\n0.2 == 0.6 / 3\n# example 2\npoint3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)\npoint3\npoint3 == 0.3\n\nTo work around these issues, you could use all.equal() for checking the equality of two double quantities in R. What does all.equal() do?\n\n# example 1, all.equal()\nall.equal(0.2, 0.6 / 3)\n# example 2, all.equal()\npoint3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)\npoint3\nall.equal(point3, rep(.3, length(point3)))\n\n\nInefficient math.\n\nYou‚Äôve collected 10 million observations in a vector called x and you summarize the mean of your observations:\n\n\nset.seed(2)\nn = 10000000\nx = rnorm(n, 1, 10)\nxbar = mean(x)\n\nA new observation comes in new_x = 15.0.\n\nnew_x = 15\nupdated_x = c(x, new_x)\n\nAlthough it won‚Äôt change much, you want to recompute the mean with this new data point. You could recompute the mean by re-running mean() on updated_x or you could observe that:\n\\[\n\\bar{x}_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{n+1}(n \\cdot\\bar{x}_n + x_{n+1})\n\\]\nCompare the time each method takes by surrounding each method with system.time({}).\n\n# method 1\nmean(updated_x)\n\n\n#method 2\n## program the equation above here and then time it with system.time({})\n\n\nInefficient code.\n\nTo quantify the inefficiency of a poorly written for loop, time both the code blocks below. Experiment with different values of n.¬†What do you observe?\n\n\n# method 1\nn <- 10\nx <- 1\nfor (i in seq_len(n)) {\n  x <- c(x, sqrt(x[i] * i))\n}\n\n\n# method 2\nn <- 10\nx <- rep(1, n + 1)\nfor (i in seq_len(n)) {\n  x[i + 1] <- sqrt(x[i] * i)\n}\n\n\nVector norms.\n\nIf \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are scalar numbers, \\(x<y\\) makes sense. How do you compare the size of two different vectors \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)? A very typical way is the vector norm. The p-norm of vector \\(x\\) of length \\(n\\) is:\n\\[\n||x||_p = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i |^p \\right)^{1/p}\n\\]\nfor \\(p = 1, 2, ...\\). For example, if \\(p = 2\\) we have the Euclidean norm, also known as the \\(l_2\\) (read ‚ÄúL-2‚Äù) norm.\n\nVerify that the Euclidean norm of \\(x = \\left( 1, 2.5, -6.3 \\right)\\) is 6.851277 in R. You can compute the \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) norms in R using norm(x, type = \"1\") and norm(x, type = \"2\") respectively. Read the documentation, ?norm() and you will see you need to make sure the argument x is a matrix.\nCompare \\(||x||_2\\) and \\(||y||_2\\) where \\(y = \\left(0.8, 2.4, -6.4 \\right)\\).\nCompare \\(||x||_1\\) and \\(||y||_1\\), where again \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the vectors given above. Which is larger?"
